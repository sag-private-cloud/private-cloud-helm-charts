# Delite Icon Pack

This package provides the standard Delite icons in the following three formats:

  - Icon fonts
  - SVG icons
  - SVG sprite

## Icon fonts

The icons are provided as fonts in various formats together with the corresponding CSS font and class definitions. An HTML preview page serves up all icons for quick reference.

Note that the unicode positions may change with each new release. So be sure to use the CSS files and fonts from the same package version.

## SVG icons

The SVG icons are provided with an original size of 24x24px.

## SVG sprite

The SVG icons are provided as sprite in the Sprite subfolder. This format reduces the number of HTTP calls compared with individual icons. This os also an alternative where using an icon font is not possible or when multicolor icons are needed.

## How to use

Please check the showcase.html page in the root folder for the usages. It also has the list of icons available with their class names.
